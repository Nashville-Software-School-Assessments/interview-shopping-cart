# Debugging and Data Flow Assessment

## Setting Up

1. Click the Gitpod button above. If requested, authorize with Github.
2. After the virtual machine is set up, a terminal will appear at the bottom of the editor.
3. Paste the command `serve -l 8080` into the terminal to start the web server.
4. A new browser window will open where the code is running.
5. Remember that this isn't `create-react-app` so you will need to manually refresh the running code when you make changes in the editor.

## Assessment

Open `main.js` and read the instructions contained therein. Your job during this process is to demonstrate your command of the dev tools and debugging. Show how to set breakpoints, step over code, and examine the values of variables.
